# Run Like The Wind (ASP.NET Core Web API/Angular Demo)

The RunLikeTheWind is probably the worlds worst running coach :). It fetches weather data and mainly advises you to:  

* Go for PBs (Personal bests) by running in the same direction as the wind if the weather is windy :) . 
* If the weather is calm it recommends a tempo run. 
* If the weather is above 25 degrees celcius, you are wisely advised to stay hydrated and go for a very easy run. 


The RunLikeTheWind project has some component layering and interfacing so that it may grow as it recieves 
feedback and suggestions from its millions of users and more data to analyse in order to make good workout suggestions. 
E.g A databsae, authentication, a users last x number of strava activities, a users latest health readings from their wearables, 
resting, variable heart rate, future race/distance goals etc...
